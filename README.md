### <p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700;">usage scenarios</p>
perhaps you want to see what homebridge is all about, without actually owning a single accessory!<br>
&emsp; just [Install](#installation) and use the [demo config](#Configuration) and you can try out pretty much all homebridge has to offer<br>
<br>
or perhaps you want to integrate a device into homebridge without writing your own plugin!<br>
&emsp; with a [Custom config](#Configuration) cmd4 brings cli support for all [Supported Accessories][docs] so you can write simple scripts in any language.
<br><br><br><br>




### <p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700;">Installation</p>
####  &emsp; &emsp; 1. Install [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge?tab%253Dreadme-ov-file#installation)
####  &emsp; &emsp; 2. Install Homebridge Cmd4 plugin either via the [homebridge ui](http://localhost:8581/plugins) or via npm
```bash
   sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge-cmd4
```
<br><br><br><br>





### <p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700;">Configuration</p>
#### &emsp; &emsp; To Demo use the provided [demo config](Extras/config.json)
> [!NOTE]
> save or backup your config `.homebridge/config.json` befor this command
```bash
   cp /usr/local/lib/node_modules/homebridge-cmd4/Extras/config.json $HOME/.homebridge/
```
<br><br>

####  &emsp; &emsp; Custom config via [homebridge ui editor](http://localhost:8581/config)
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The Demo config has no polling defined. When no polling is defined for that accessory all values are retrieved and set from cache.<br>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Only for polled characteristics the statecmd is called. ok. it is simpler than it sounds lets see a basic example
```json
   1  {
   2      "platform": "Cmd4", 
   3      "name": "Cmd4",
   4      "debug": true,   // true here to see more clearly whats happening
   5      "accessories": [
   6      {
   7          "type": "Lightbulb",    // Type of Accessory or Device
   8          "name": "TestLight",
   9          "displayName": "TestLight",
  10          "on": "0",    // for Lightbulbs on is a Required Characteristic see docs
  11          "brightness": 10,    // for Lightbulbs brightness is an Optional Characteristic see docs 
  12          "state_cmd": "python3 script.py",    // see below state cmd
  13          "polling": true    // see below polling
  14      }
  15      ]
  16  },
```
#### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; required & optional Characteristics
in the [docs][docs] all required & optional characteristics are listed for each Accessory

#### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; state cmd
this command is called with some arguments for all **polled** characteristics<br>
the arguments either are `'get'` `'characteristic'` or `'set'` `'characteristic'` `'value'`<br>
&emsp; so eg. you open the home app - this causes cmd4 to `get` the `on` Characteristic - and the command looks like<br>
`python3 script.py 'get' 'on'` and cmd4 expects a return value either `1` or `0`<br>
&emsp; or you tap the lightbulb in the home app - this causes cmd4 to `set` the `on` Characteristic - and the command looks like<br>
`python3 script.py 'set' 'on' '1'`<br>
so your script has to handle the arguments accordingly see script [templates & examples](Extras/Cmd4Scripts/Examples) and [docs][docs] under Script Templates <br>

#### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; polling
polling `true` enables the statecmd only for **Required** Characteristics so here only for `on` the state cmd is called see scenario above<br>
to poll, alias enable the state cmd, for **optional** Characteristics you have to impement polling per characteristic<br>
```json
  13          "polling": [
                  {"characteristic": "on", "interval": 2},  // interval in seconds
                  {"characteristic": "brightness", "interval": 2}
              ]
```
<br><br><br><br>




### <p style="font-size: 23px; font-weight: 700;">Advanced Features</p>
#### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Grouped Accessories
with [grouped Accessories or linked Types](https://github.com/ztalbot2000/homebridge-cmd4/issues/121#issuecomment-1010596136) you can combine multible accessories into one tile in the home app. like<br>

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;

</p>


and many more posebileties with [**Fakegato History**](https://github.com/ztalbot2000/homebridge-cmd4/blob/master/docs/Developers.md#adding-in-fakegato-history) and [**Priority & Queued Polling**](https://github.com/ztalbot2000/homebridge-cmd4/blob/master/docs/Developers.md#priority-queued-polling)

HomeKit or Eve. (Except Camera Streaming).



<BR><BR>
## How the Cmd4 Plugin Works
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cmd4 comes with a fully populated and documented config.json file that is set to using just the cached entry's in the config file itself. This makes HomeKit behave as if you actually have all these Accessories!
   If you choose to add in your own scripts, the Cmd4 Github pages at [ http://ztalbot2000.github.io/homebridge-cmd4](https://ztalbot2000.github.io/homebridge-cmd4) have example script templates and further development instructions.



<BR><BR>
## Features
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cmd4 supports, Lights, Garage Door Openers, Outlets, Switches, Lock Maintenance Systems, Lock Management Systems, Humidity Sensors, Doors, Light Sensors, Temperature Sensors, Contact Sensors, Motion Sensors, Thermostats, Security Systems, Battery Services, Filter Maintenance Systems, Air Purifiers, Television, Television Speaker, Input Sources, Irrigation Systems,  ... everything but Camera Streaming since it is not pliable to a command line Interface.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cmd4 Polling is a way to in the background update the state of devices via the 'polling' dirctive.
<UL>
<LI> "polling": "on" - Implements polling of the default characteristics of the defined "timeout" and "stateChangeResponseTime".
<LI> "polling": [{ "characteristic": "<characteristic">", [ "timeout": <timeout in msec>, "stateChangeResponseTime": <stateChangeResponseTime in sec> ] }] - implements per characteristic polling.
</UL>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cmd4 supports Fakegato History and retaining previous state over restarts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since version 2.0 Cmd4 has supported linked Accessories and the latest 3.0 Version supports both Platform plugin and Accessory plugin configurations as documented on [developers.homebridge.io](https://developers.homebridge.io).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cmd4 Version 3.5 adds in support for Custom Characteristics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cmd4 Version 3.6 allows you to configure Priority Queued Polling so that the accessory only receives one request at a time; with priority to all IOS requests first and polling second.

<BR><BR>
## Demo Mode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The config.json provided has no polling defined. Demo mode is achieved when no polling of any kind for that accessory is defined. In this way all values are retrieved and set from cache.

<BR><BR>
## Basic Troubleshooting

### Error: Command failed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This error is indicative to many situations. The most common is that the command took to long to run.

```
  Error: Command failed: /homebridge/Server.sh Get 'Server' 'On'

    at ChildProcess.exithandler (child_process.js:297:12)
    at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:193:13)
    at maybeClose (internal/child_process.js:1001:16)
    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:266:5)
  killed: true
  code: null
  signal: SIGTERM,
  cmd: "/homebridge/Server.sh Get Server On"

```

Check that the command exists, but also that the timeout value in your config.json for that accessory is not too low.

### Debug Steps
   New in Cmd4 v4.0.0 is how to enable Debug mode. The logs are 100% the same, except that now that Cmd4 has its own logging system ( Copied from Homebridge for compatability ); Enabling Debug logs will not enable Debug logs in other plugins. <BR>
   There are two ways to enable Cmd4 Debug logs.

#### Method 1.  Modifying the Cmd4 Platform section
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cmd4 Platform section can contain the enable Debug directive.

```json
   {
      "platform": "Cmd4",
      "name": "Cmd4",
      "debug": true
   }
```

#### Method 2.  Add DEBUG environental variable

```bash
   *SHELL*> DEBUG=Cmd4
```
Note: For Homebridge-config-ui-x, you only need to write Cmd4 in the Environmental variable section.


<BR><BR>
## Rationale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After playing with homebridge-cmd and then homebridge-cmdswitch2, I really wanted to control as much as I could.  I did not have all the devices, but I did have a light and a Sony Android TV.  I wanted to control these and see what else I could do.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you were wondering what happened to version 3, well I learned a lot, hence the working cmd4.
